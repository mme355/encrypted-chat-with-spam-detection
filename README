this code should be used in an IDE/Compiler that supports saving the file and running it in CMD because of the nature of the output that needs two sperate consoles. 
if you do go into command prompt put the file path after cd and start working on installing the required packeges and then run otherwise you'll find yourself with
 line[4096] error when you have 82 to 100 lines of code 
                                                       # feel free to use code as a refrence or to solve an upcoming project/HW
